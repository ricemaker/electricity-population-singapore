Visualization of pearson correlation matrix of Singapore's population structure with electricity usage and generation

The jupyter notebook explores 2 datasets orginating from SingStats:  
1. Singapore's population structure  
2. Singapore's electric generation/consumption  
  
This is my first data science project where I use the Python pandas library to clean and merge the 2 datasets as well as matplotlib to visualize it
